# EmbeddedNN-PowerOptimization
Reducing Energy Consumption of Neural Network Processing on Embedded Accelerators

It implements a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) for face recognition / face ID, targeted for low-power deployment (MAX78000 chip).

The design is inspired by MobileNet-style bottleneck blocks â†’ efficient, low-compute, low-memory.

The final output is a low-dimensional embedding (e.g., 64-D vector) that represents a face in a normalized feature space.
